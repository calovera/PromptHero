# Overview

PromptHero is a fully functional Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that helps users optimize their AI prompts using Google's Gemini AI. The extension provides real-time scoring (1-10 rating), intelligent optimization suggestions, and comprehensive history tracking. Built with React, TypeScript, and Radix UI, it features a modern dark theme interface with popup and options pages. The extension is production-ready with complete Gemini API integration, local storage management, and a robust build system.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with @radix-ui/themes for consistent dark mode theming
- **Component Structure**: Modular approach with dedicated components for different functionality areas (PromptEditor, ScorePanel, ImprovedPanel, HistoryList, Toolbar)
- **Pages**: Two main interfaces - popup (400x600px) for quick interactions and options page for configuration

## Chrome Extension Architecture
- **Manifest Version**: V3 with modern service worker background script
- **Extension Structure**: 
  - Popup interface for primary prompt optimization workflow
  - Options page for API key management and settings
  - Background service worker for API communication and data processing
- **Permissions**: Storage for local data persistence, host permissions for Gemini API access
- **Message Passing**: Typed message system between popup, options, and background scripts

## Data Management
- **Local Storage**: Chrome's sync storage for API keys, prompt history, and user settings
- **State Management**: Component-level React state with Chrome storage integration
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type safety and validation
- **History Tracking**: Persistent storage of prompt iterations with metadata (scores, timestamps, types)

## API Integration Design
- **AI Service**: Google Gemini API integration for prompt scoring and optimization
- **Authentication**: API key stored locally in Chrome storage, never transmitted to third parties
- **Request Types**: Structured message system for scoring prompts, optimizing prompts, and testing API keys
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly feedback

## Security Model
- **Data Privacy**: All user data stored locally, API keys never leave the user's browser
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS-only API calls to Google's Gemini service
- **Permissions**: Minimal required permissions for storage and specific API access

# External Dependencies

## Core Framework Dependencies
